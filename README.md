<h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
This project is my attempt at completing the Caesar Cipher assignment from The Odin Project. A Caesar cipher is a simple and well-known encryption technique in which each letter in a message is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet. For example, a right shift of 5 would turn "What a string!" into "Bmfy f xywnsl!". This Ruby implementation takes a string and a shift value, applies a right shift, and returns the encrypted messageâ€”preserving case and punctuation.
